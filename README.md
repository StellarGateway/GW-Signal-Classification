# GW Signal Classification

A Deep Learning project for classifying gravitational wave signals vs glitches using Transformer-based Auto-Encoder architecture.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can distinguish between gravitational wave signals and glitches in strain data. The approach is inspired by the Transformer-based Auto-Encoder paper: [https://arxiv.org/html/2212.14283v2](https://arxiv.org/html/2212.14283v2)
